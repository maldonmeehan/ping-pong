_This is an Epicodus student project to create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the inputed number with the following exceptions:_
* _Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"_
* _Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"_

Restrict input to positive numbers only  | -1  | Alert: input field will only accept positive numbers
Find multiples of 15 (15,30,) with in the array of 1 to the inputed number and replace them with pingpong | 15 | (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,pingpong,)
Find multiples of 5 (5,10,15) with in the array of 1 to the inputed number and replace them with pong | 15 | (1,2,3,4,pong,6,7,8,9,pong,11,12,13,14,pong,)
Find multiples of 3 (3,6,9) with in the array of 1 to the inputed number and replace them with ping | 15 | (1,2,ping,4,5,ping,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,ping,)
